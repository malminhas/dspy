            <div class="summary">Google has introduced Web Guide, an experimental AI-powered feature in Search Labs that organizes search results into categories based on the intent behind a query. Web Guide uses a custom version of Gemini to better understand both the search query and web content, employing a query fan-out technique to issue multiple related searches and surface relevant results. Initially available on the Web tab, it is designed to help with open-ended searches like "how to solo travel in Japan" and detailed queries such as maintaining family relationships across time zones. Users can opt in to try Web Guide and switch back to standard results at any time, with potential expansion to other search tabs in the future.</div>

The virtual try-on feature, now available in the U.S., lets users upload a photo to see how different apparel items would look on them. Additionally, Google has upgraded its price alerts to allow users to specify preferred sizes, colors, and prices, ensuring they are notified when products meet their criteria. Starting this fall, AI Mode will offer shoppable outfit and room inspiration, further integrating AI into the shopping process to provide users with tailored product suggestions.</div>

            <div class="summary">Outtake uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o and OpenAI o3 models to automate cybersecurity threat detection and remediation, scanning millions of digital surfaces continuously to identify and classify risks with high accuracy and speed. This AI-driven system processes complex multimodal data, correlates signals across platforms to detect coordinated attacks, and automates enforcement actions, reducing takedown times from 60 days to hours and preventing significant fraud losses. Customers maintain control over decision logic and can update rules in real time, enabling adaptive defenses against fast-evolving threats. Outtakeâ€™s internal evaluations show OpenAI models outperform alternatives in reasoning and accuracy, making them essential for handling complex cybersecurity challenges. This innovative approach replaces slower manual reviews, providing enterprise security teams with reliable, 24/7 protection that keeps pace with rapidly mutating digital threats.</div>
